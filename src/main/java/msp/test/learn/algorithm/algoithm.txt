1. Time Complexity

        1.1 Array :

            1.1.1 Read , Write , Update :

                It takes a same time for read , write and update in array this is takes constant time so time

                complexity is O(1).

            1.1.2 Insert :

                It takes base on inputs we takes worst case if totally 10 records if i insert 2nd place it moves all

                records and insert that value in 2nd place so its time is linear time based on records and time

                complexity is O(n).

            1.1.3 Delete :

                Same as Insert .

            1.1.4 Search :

                Same as Insert based on records we take worst case we want to search last record its time in linear based

                on total records so time complexity is O(n).
