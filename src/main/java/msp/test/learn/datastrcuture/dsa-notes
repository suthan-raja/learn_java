Data structure

A data structure is a meaningful way of arranging and storing data in a computer (RAM) so as to use it efficiently .

Data structure have a 3 types

    1. Linear
    2. Non - Linear
    3. Associative

1. Linear

    Linear Have 2 types that are ,

        1.1. static
        1.2. dynamic

1.1 static

    Static Have one Data Structure that is Array .

1.2 dynamic

    Dynamic Have Some Data structure they are ,

        1. Linked List
        2. Stack
        3. Queue

2. Non - Linear

    Non - Linear have two type of data structure they are ,

        2.1 Tree
        2.2 Graph

3. Associative

    Associative have one data structure that is Hash Maps.

Algorithms

    An algorithms is step by step unambiguous set of instruction for solving problem.

    we can define algorithms for simple real life scenarios like making a pack of noodles to something like
    playing or suggesting the best photo.

    From washing machines to self-driving cars every deterministic action can be using an algorithm.

Topic - 1                               Arrays

An array is linear collection of elements of the same type.

Arrays are used to store multiple values in a  single variable , instead of declaring separate variables for each value.
Each Array location is accessed using an index, the indexing starts from 0.

                                    Advantages of Array

       * Simple and easy to use .
       * Fast insertion at the end of the array.  O(1) time
       * An array element can be accessed in constant time.

                                    Disadvantages of Array

       * Arrays have fixed size can't grow in memory once allocated.
       * Insertion is the middle requires shifting of elements. O(N) times
       * Since array requires linear memory block , such blocks might not be available especially if the array size is big.

Java Collections Framework

    Java collections framework provides set of classes and interfaces, to manipulate , organise and perform operations on data
    without writing your own data structures from scratch.

    It provides you with data-structures and their associated methods that can do anything that you'll ever need to do.

Why use Java Collections Framework ?

    * Use in-build data structures come very handy when are you solving problems or building real software.

    * The data structures are highly optimised and also saves a lot of development time.
